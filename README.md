 
# Time Series Analysis

 To do build statistiscal  and deep learning time series forecasting models and their performance.
eg: arima,sarima,lstm,gru on univariate and multivariate datasets.

Here, univariate dataset of airpassengers is used to build arima,sarima,Exponential smoothening. 

Multivariate Stock price  dataset is used for building lstm and gru deep learning models.Perdictions are made on test dataset
